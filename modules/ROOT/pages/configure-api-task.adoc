= Configuring an API Instance Endpoint on API Manager
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

You can set up one of the following types of endpoint management:

* Direct management of the endpoint: Basic endpoint
+
Set up a basic endpoint.
+
* Management by proxy: Endpoint with proxy
+
Set up a basic endpoint if you create your API outside API Manager. For example, if you create the API using Mule Runtime, you don't need a proxy.

You can save and later modify configuration of an API versions or instance.

. In API Manager, click the version, or an instance, of an API.
+
If you previously created an instance of the version, click the instance you want to reconfigure.
+
API Configuration appears.

+
. Above API Configuration, in Add Consumer Endpoint, optionally enter the public-facing URL for the API. For example, enter `+http://product.mydomain.com+`.
+
. In *Managing Type* at the bottom of the page, select *Basic Endpoint* or *Endpoint with Proxy*.
+
. Select the *Mule version* box if you want to manage APIs in Mule 4 or later.
. In *Implementation URI*, either enter the URL of the site that hosts the API or accept the default, a dummy URI.
+
Typically, you accept the default. The URI is not required, and often unknown, at this point.
. From *Client provider*, select the IdP that you want to use to authenticate access to this API from registered client applications:
+

+
If no client providers are set up for your environment and organization, this field is not visible.
* If you chose *Endpoint With Proxy*, select a proxy deployment target CloudHub or Hybrid installation.
+
Hybrid is a product for managing servers. You need to register a server with Mule Agent 1.9.0 to deploy the API to a Mule 3.8 or later hybrid target.
+
If you choose Endpoint With Proxy, also accept the default Path `/` for the proxy endpoint, or enter another path. For example, changing the path to `/users` makes the REST call to the service at the implementation URI `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users+`.
. In *Advanced Options*, optionally assign an instance label for the proxy, or accept the label, and set a response timeout.
.. At the top of API Configuration section, click *ADD A TAG* to enter a tag name, such as Released, to signal the status of an API version to users.
. Click *Save*.

Now, you are ready to configure deployment.
